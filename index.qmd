# About

hi ! I'm Janthina. In my project, I have chosen to explore the trends in Olympic Swimming.

#### Data 

Link to the data set that I have chosen:
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasciencedonut/olympic-swimming-1912-to-2020>

Since the athletes are categorized by 'Team' using the country codes assigned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) instead of their country's names, we can use the following data set to assign them:

<https://github.com/johnashu/datacamp/blob/master/medals/Summer%20Olympic%20medalists%201896%20to%202008%20-%20IOC%20COUNTRY%20CODES.csv>

```         
# Load required R packages
library(tidyverse)
library(highcharter) 

# Set highcharter options
options(highcharter.theme = hc_theme_smpl(tooltip = list(valueDecimals = 2)))

# Load Data 
olympicswimming <- read.csv("/Users/janthinatan/Desktop/NM2207/Final Project/olympicswimming.csv")
#Filter out the medalists 
olympicmedalists <- olympicswimming %>% filter(Rank<4)

#load IOC code names
ioc_data<-read_csv("/Users/janthinatan/Desktop/NM2207/Final Project/ioc country codes.csv")

ioc_data <- ioc_data[c("Country", "NOC")]

olympicmedalists$Country <- ioc_data$Country[match(olympicmedalists$Team, ioc_data$NOC)]

#Name countries whose IOC is not contained in IOC dataset 

# Find the row index where Team is "ROC"
roc_row_index <- which(olympicmedalists$Team == "ROC")

# Update the corresponding row in the "Country" column
olympicmedalists$Country[roc_row_index] <- "Russia"

# Find the row index where Team is "SGP"
roc_row_index <- which(olympicmedalists$Team == "SGP")

# Update the corresponding row in the "Country" column
olympicmedalists$Country[roc_row_index] <- "Singapore"

# Find the row index where Team is "ROU"
roc_row_index <- which(olympicmedalists$Team == "ROU")

# Update the corresponding row in the "Country" column
olympicmedalists$Country[roc_row_index] <- "Romania"

# Find the row index where Team is "USA"
roc_row_index <- which(olympicmedalists$Team == "USA")

# Update the corresponding row in the "Country" column
olympicmedalists$Country[roc_row_index] <- "United States of America"

#Group Countries by number of medals 
medalspercountry <- olympicmedalists %>% group_by(Country) %>% summarise(Medals=n())

# Load the world Map data
data(worldgeojson, package = "highcharter")

#Choose colours 
colors  <- c("#ECEFFF","#4967FF","#001A9E","#000A3F")

#Create map 
worldmap <- highchart() %>%
  hc_add_series_map(
    worldgeojson, medalspercountry, value = "Medals", joinBy = c('name','Country'),
    name = "Oympic Swimming Medals by Country"
    )  %>% 
  hc_colorAxis(minColor = "#ECEFFF", maxColor="#000A3F", stops = color_stops(n=length(colors),colors=colors)) %>% 
  hc_title(text = "World Map") %>% 
  hc_subtitle(text = "Olympic Swimming Medals by Country 1912-2020")
