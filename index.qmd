# About

hi ! I'm Janthina. In my project, I have chosen to explore the trends in Olympic Swimming.

#### Data 

Link to the data set that I have chosen:
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasciencedonut/olympic-swimming-1912-to-2020>

Since the athletes are categorized by 'Team' using the country codes assigned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) instead of their country's names, we can use the following data set to assign them:

<https://github.com/johnashu/datacamp/blob/master/medals/Summer%20Olympic%20medalists%201896%20to%202008%20-%20IOC%20COUNTRY%20CODES.csv>

```         
{r}
#| out.width: "80%"
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false
#| eval: FALSE
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) +
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```
