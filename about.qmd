## Hi I'm Janthina!

I am currently a Year 2 undergraduate at the National University of Singapore pursing an honours degree in Political Science with a minor in Economics and (hopefully) a minor in Interactive Media Design.

I stumbled upon the existence of a minor in "Interactive Media Design" while exploring ways in which I could incorporate my interests in visual art into my prospective career options. Hence, my presence in this module.

When I am not preoccupied in my attempts to be an academic weapon, I enjoy playing a variety of sports such as Badminton, Squash and Touch Rugby - which I represent NUS Raffles Hall in playing. I am also actively engaged as an EXCO member of the Block 8 Committee and Raffles Volunteer Corp (Children). Aside from these in-school hustles, I have also worked part-time as a B![]()arista, Inline Skating Instructor as well as Studio Assistant at an Art Studio which crafts bespoke art experiences for a range of clients.

While I am usually unfazed by taking up challenges in the spirit of exploring my interests, I must admit now that choosing to take this module with zero coding experience may have been one of the biggest leaps of faith I have taken thus far (comparable to when I signed up to climb Mount Rinjani with no climbing experience last year).

Feel free to poke around my page and see what I've been up to in this module!

Cheers!

Janthina
