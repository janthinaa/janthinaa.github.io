    "text": "Olympic Swimming History 1912-2020\nIn light of the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympics, let us dive into some trends surrounding Olympic Swimming!\n\nBackground\nThe first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896. The first Olympics introduced some interesting races into the lineup, such us the 100m free for sailors which was strictly for members of the Greek Navy and all of the races were held in open water.\nUntil 1912, only male swimmers were allowed to compete in the Olympics. Women only began to compete at the Stockholm Olympics when they were finally allowed in water. In that year, they could only compete in the 100 free and 400 free relay.\n\n\nTotal Swimming Medals\n\nknitr::asis_output('&lt;iframe height=\"500\" width=\"120%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://janthina.shinyapps.io/InteractiveMap/\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;')\n\n \n\n\n\nknitr::asis_output('&lt;iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://janthina.shinyapps.io/InteractiveBarChart/\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;')"

    "text": "About Me\nI am currently a Year 2 undergraduate at the National University of Singapore pursing an honours degree in Political Science with a minor in Economics and (hopefully) a minor in Interactive Media Design.\nI stumbled upon the existence of a minor in “Interactive Media Design” while exploring ways in which I could incorporate my interests in visual art into my prospective career options. Hence, my presence in this module.\nWhen I am not preoccupied in my attempts to be an academic weapon, I enjoy playing a variety of sports such as Badminton, Squash and Touch Rugby - which I represent NUS Raffles Hall in playing. I am also actively engaged as an EXCO member of the Block 8 Committee and Raffles Volunteer Corp (Children). Aside from these in-school hustles, I have also worked part-time as a Barista, Inline Skating Instructor as well as Studio Assistant at an Art Studio which crafts bespoke art experiences for a range of clients.\nWhile I am usually unfazed by taking up challenges in pursuit of my interest, I must admit now that choosing to take this module with zero coding experience my have been the biggest leap of faith I am taken thus far.\nFeel free to poke around my page and see what I’ve been up to in this module!\nCheers!\nJanthina"
