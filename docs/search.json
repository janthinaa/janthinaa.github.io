    "text": "Olympic Swimming History 1912-2020\n\n\n\n\n\nIn light of the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympics, let us dive into some trends surrounding Olympic Swimming\n\nThe first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896. The first Olympics introduced some interesting races into the lineup, such us the 100m free for sailors which was strictly for members of the Greek Navy and all of the races were held in open water.\nUntil 1912, only male swimmers were allowed to compete in the Olympics. Women only began to compete at the Stockholm Olympics when they were finally allowed in water. In that year, they could only compete in the 100 free and 400 free relay.\n\nWhich Countries Have Been Most Dominant?\n\n\n\nHere is a brief overview of the countries which have been most successful in Olympic Swimming. Zoom in to take a closer look!\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAt the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the United States of America took home 30 medals in swimming, adding to the incredible haul of medals that it has been accumulating since the start of the Olympic Games. In comparison, Australia and Japan which are ranked second and third in the overall medal count only bagged 21 and 3 medals respectively. Additionally, 25% of total medals won by the USA in the games that year came from swimming alone.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwimming Results Over Time\n\n\n\nHow have Olympic swimming results changed over time?\n\nOlympic swimming performances have made significant improvements since 1912. The reasons for improvement are due in part to advanced training procedures, increasingly sophisticated selection methods, superior stroke mechanics, increased access to the sport or even new swimwear technologies. Most importantly, this is possible due to the International Swimming Federation’s openness in developing competition rules such as exploring new swimming techniques, swimmer’s gear and swimwear as well as swimming pool equipment while ensuring that the final performance is determined by human skills and quality of training rather than technology.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nImprovement How?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidently, women have achieved a higher absolute improvement in swimming timings compared to men. This can be attributed to the lesser time that women have spent in the competitive swimming scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwing to a greater rate of improvement in female swimmers, we can observe a diminishing difference between the results of female and male athletes. Take for example tht 100m Freestyle event, the 1952 difference between male and female gold medalists was 19.40 s and had dropped to 4.094 s by 2020\n\nIs Swimming Performance Reaching its Peak\n\n\n\nWhat are the limits of atheletic performance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite female athletes improving at a faster rate than their male counterparts, both demographics are experiencing improvements at decreasing rates. Given years of rapid development that has occurred since 1912 within the spheres of human physiology, economics, global environment and more, performance in humans and animals have experiences a plateau in the last 20-30 years. Fortunately, technological innovations may alleviate the effects of such stagnation, depending on the evolution of rules and regulations.
